A Scottish charity has the aim of encouraging the general population to take a more active role in the
governance of the country. One way that they feel that this could be done is to encourage people to enter into
more informed dialogue with their elected representatives. In order to do this they wish to develop an
informational web resource which will allow individuals to enter a post code and find out information about
that area in terms of employment, schooling, health, social care etc along with the names of the elected
representatives who hold responsibility for these areas. It is intended that this resource will be developed
over time as relevant information becomes available. As a first step they have asked you to develop a website
which gives people information on the proportion of the population engaged in different occupations in
specified geographical areas of the country and also provides user with the name of the MSP for the area in
question.

The aim of the site is to give member of the public access to the information in an easy to understand visual
format and to allow them to find out the MSP responsible for representing each area.
As a minimum the site should allow users to enter a postcode and should then display information about the
proportion of the population engaged in different categories of work. Information should be displayed in an
attractive and easy to understand format. The site should also display details about the MSP for the area in
question.

It would also be useful if the website could allow users to find out information about the rates of pay for
different occupations and how these have changed over time.

The emphasis should be presenting the information clearly, in an easy to use and interactive format.
